        Overview
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is a subproject of <b>jcel</b> and contains the
        interface to use the <a href="http://owlcs.github.io/owlapi/">OWL API</a>.

      <h2>
        Package dependencies
      </h2>
      <p>
        If we consider each package as a node, and each dependency
        between two packages as a directed edge, the structure of
        package dependency should be a directed acyclic graph
        (DAG). The packages should only make public those classes
        that are or could be used by another package preserving the
        DAG structure.
