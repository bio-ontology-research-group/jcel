        Overview
      </h2>
      <p>
        This program is a reasoner based on the CEL algorithm. The
        CEL system is known for its scalability of reasoning in the
        lightweight description logic EL<sup>++</sup>. This logic
        has been proved suitable for several ontology applications,
        most notably from the life science domain. The description
        logic EL<sup>++</sup> has been adopted as the logical basis
        of the OWL 2 EL profile of the new Web Ontology Language,
        integrating the reasoner to the OWL user community.

        Main steps of the classification algorithm.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>translate OWL API symbols into integer numbers
        </li>
        <li>run the configuration, which:
          <ul>
            <li>normalizes the ontology creating auxiliary entities
            </li>
            <li>creates an extended ontonlogy based on the
            normalized ontology
            </li>
            <li>creates the role hierarchy
            </li>
            <li>prepares the queue to run the algorithm
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>while there is any change, process the queue
        </li>
        <li>remove auxiliary entities
        </li>
        <li>build a graph containing direct subsumers (parents),
        direct subsumees (children) and equivalents
        </li>
        <li>create OWL API data structures based on the integer
        graph
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        Package dependencies
      </h2>
      <p>
        If we think each package as a node, and each dependency
        between two packages as a directed edge, the structure of
        package dependency should be a directed acyclic graph
        (DAG). The packages should only make public those classes
        that are or could be used by another package preserving the
        DAG structure.
      </p>
