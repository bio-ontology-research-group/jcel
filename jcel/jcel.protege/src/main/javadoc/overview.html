    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>This program is a semantic reasoner that classifies <a href=
    "http://dl.kr.org/">descriptions logics</a> of the EL family. The description logic
    EL<sup>++</sup> has been adopted for the <a href=
    "http://www.w3.org/2007/OWL/wiki/OWL_Working_Group">OWL 2 EL</a> profile.</p>This
    program uses the <a href="http://owlapi.sourceforge.net">OWL API</a>. The algorithm:

    <ul>
      <li>translates OWL API axioms into jcel axioms, which are composed by integer
      numbers;</li>

      <li>detects the expressivity used in the axioms;</li>

      <li>applies normalization rules to the set of axioms, producing a set of normalized
      axioms and auxiliary entities if necessary;</li>

      <li>saturates the set of normalized axioms with deduced object property
      axioms;</li>

      <li>creates an extended ontonlogy based on the set of normalized axioms;</li>

      <li>applies the completion rules while there is some change in the affected
      sets;</li>

      <li>removes the auxiliary entities;</li>

      <li>builds a graph containing direct subsumers (parents), direct subsumees
      (children) and equivalents;</li>

      <li>creates OWL API data structures based on the jcel's integer
      representation.</li>
    </ul>For more details, visit the <a href="http://jcel.sourceforge.net">web site</a>.

    <h2>Package dependencies</h2>

    <p>If we consider each package as a node, and each dependency between two packages as
    a directed edge, the structure of package dependency should be a directed acyclic
    graph (DAG). The packages should only make public those classes that are or could be
    used by another package preserving the DAG structure.</p>
