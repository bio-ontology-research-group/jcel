        Overview
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is a subproject of <b>jcel</b> and contains its core.
        This means that all the classification algorithms are
        implemented in this subproject. Besides, classes and
        properties are coded as integer numbers. Axioms are also
        simple structures based on integer numbers. The main class
        is the <tt>Processor</tt>. Once it is configured, it is
        possible to run the classification algorithm.<br />
        The steps to follow for an instance of <tt>Processor</tt>
        should be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>configure&lt;&gt;
        </li>
        <li>process all queues while there is a change
        </li>
        <li>post-process the data creating a graph with direct
        subsumers, direct subsumee, and equivalent vertices
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        Package dependencies
      </h2>
      <p>
        If we think each package as a node, and each dependency
        between two packages as a directed edge, the structure of
        package dependency should be a directed acyclic graph
        (DAG). The packages should only make public those classes
        that are or could be used by another package preserving the
        DAG structure.
